# Jujutsu Kaisen Anime Streaming Website

Welcome to my Jujutsu Kaisen-themed anime streaming platform!\
This project started off as a small experiment to improve my CSS skills — specifically, I was curious about designing **inverted borders**. But as I kept building... I caught feelings for it.

What started as a CSS playground became a full-blown frontend project — and then I just kept stacking features.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Video streaming doesn't currently work.**\
I implemented everything — from embedding players to setting up the UI — but unfortunately, I couldn't make the streaming functional. The reason? Most streaming solutions require **paid premium services**, and I couldn't afford them at this stage.

So for now, this project is more of a **UI/UX showcase** and **feature demo**, not a working streaming service.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Stylish UI** with custom CSS elements (inverted borders ftw!)
- **Episode list with thumbnails & descriptions**
- **Add/Edit Next Episode Release Date**
- **Admin Panel** to:
  - Add new episodes
  - Delete any episode
  - Update release schedule
- **Auth0 Integration** for secure login and admin access

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, React.js**
- **Auth0** for authentication
- **Modular file structure** for clean project separation (frontend/backend)

---

## 💡 Motivation

I didn’t plan to go this far. It all started with a bit of CSS curiosity... but I ended up learning about:

- User authentication
- Admin controls
- Responsive layouts
- Media UI/UX design

This project was both fun and a solid learning experience.

Even though it doesn't have full streaming capability (yet), I'm proud of how far it's come.\
And hey — if you're a dev with advice, or a kind soul with a streaming service plug — hit me up.
